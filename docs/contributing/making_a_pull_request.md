# Making a pull request

We are happy to accept your contributions to make `flair` better and more awesome! To avoid unnecessary work on either
side, please stick to the following process:

1. Check if there is already [an issue](https://github.com/flairNLP/flair/issues) for your concern.
2. If there is not, open a new one to start a discussion. We hate to close finished PRs!
3. If we decide your concern needs code changes, we would be happy to accept a pull request. Please consider the
   commit guidelines below.
