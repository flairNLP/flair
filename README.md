A very simple framework for **state-of-the-art NLP**. Developed by [Zalando Research](https://research.zalando.com/).

---

Flair is:

* **A powerful syntactic / semantic tagger.** Flair allows you to apply our state-of-the-art models for named entity recognition (NER), 
part-of-speech tagging (PoS) and chunking to your text.

* **A text embedding library.** Flair has simple interfaces that allow you to use and combine different word embeddings. 
In particular, you can try out our proposed 
**[contextual string embeddings](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17yVpFA7MmXaQFTe-HDpZuqw9fJlmzg56/view?usp=sharing)** 
to build your own state-of-the-art NLP methods.

* **A Pytorch NLP framework.** Our framework builds directly on [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/), making it easy to train your own models and 
experiment with new approaches using Flair embeddings and classes.


## Comparison with State-of-the-Art

Flair outperforms the previous best methods on a range of NLP tasks:

| Task | Dataset | Our Result | Previous best |
| -------------------------------    | ----------- | ---------------- | ------------- |
| Named Entity Recognition (English) | Conll-03    |  **93.09** (F1)  | *92.22 [(Peters et al., 2018)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.05365.pdf)* |
| Named Entity Recognition (English) | Ontonotes   |  **89.71** (F1)  | *86.28 [(Chiu et al., 2016)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.08308.pdf)* |
| Named Entity Recognition (German)  | Conll-03    |  **88.32** (F1)  | *78.76 [(Lample et al., 2016)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.01360)* |
| Named Entity Recognition (German)  | Germeval    |  **84.65** (F1)  | *79.08 [(Hänig et al, 2014)](http://asv.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/publication/file/300/GermEval2014_ExB.pdf)*|
| Part-of-Speech tagging | WSJ  | **97.85**  | *97.64 [(Choi, 2016)](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N16-1031)*|
| Chunking | Conll-2000  |  **96.72** (F1) | *96.36 [(Peters et al., 2017)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.00108.pdf)*

## Quick Start

### Requirements and Installation

The project is based on PyTorch 0.4+ and Python 3.6+, because methods signatures and type hints are beautiful.
If you do not have Python 3.6, install it first. [Here is how for Ubuntu 16.04](http://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2017/07/install-python-3-6-1-in-ubuntu-16-04-lts/). 
Then, in your favorite virtual environment, simply do:

```
pip install flair
```

### Example Usage

Let's run named entity recognition (NER) over an example sentence. All you need to do is make a `Sentence`, load 
a pre-trained model and use it to predict tags for the sentence:

```python
from flair.data import Sentence
from flair.models import SequenceTagger

# make a sentence
sentence = Sentence('I love Berlin .')

# load the NER tagger
tagger = SequenceTagger.load('ner')

# run NER over sentence
tagger.predict(sentence)
```

Done! The `Sentence` now has entity annotations. Print the sentence to see what the tagger found.

```python
print(sentence)
print('The following NER tags are found:')
print(sentence.to_tagged_string())
```

This should print: 

```console
Sentence: "I love Berlin ." - 4 Tokens

The following NER tags are found: 

I love Berlin <S-LOC> .
```


## Tutorial

We provide a set of quick tutorials to get you started with the library:

* [Tutorial 1: Basics](/resources/docs/TUTORIAL_BASICS.md)
* [Tutorial 2: Tagging your Text](/resources/docs/TUTORIAL_TAGGING.md)
* [Tutorial 3: Using Word Embeddings](/resources/docs/TUTORIAL_WORD_EMBEDDING.md)
* [Tutorial 4: Using Text Embeddings](/resources/docs/TUTORIAL_TEXT_EMBEDDINGS.md)
* [Tutorial 5: Training your own Models](/resources/docs/TUTORIAL_TRAINING_A_MODEL.md)
 
The tutorials explain how the base NLP classes work, how you can load pre-trained models to tag your
text, how you embed your text with different word embeddings, and how you can train your own 
sequence labeling models. Let us know if anything is unclear.
