A very simple framework for **state-of-the-art NLP**. Developed by [Humboldt University of Berlin](https://www.informatik.hu-berlin.de/en/forschung-en/gebiete/ml-en/) and friends.

---

Flair is:

* **A powerful NLP library.** Flair allows you to apply our state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP)
models to your text, such as named entity recognition (NER), sentiment analysis, part-of-speech tagging (PoS),
  special support for [biomedical texts](/resources/docs/HUNFLAIR2.md),
 sense disambiguation and classification, with support for a rapidly growing number of languages.

* **A text embedding library.** Flair has simple interfaces that allow you to use and combine different word and
document embeddings, including our proposed [Flair embeddings](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/C18-1139/) and various transformers.

* **A PyTorch NLP framework.** Our framework builds directly on [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), making it easy to
train your own models and experiment with new approaches using Flair embeddings and classes.

Now at [version 0.14.0](https://github.com/flairNLP/flair/releases)!


## State-of-the-Art Models

Flair ships with state-of-the-art models for a range of NLP tasks. For instance, check out our latest NER models:

| Language | Dataset | Flair | Best published | Model card & demo
|  ---  | ----------- | ---------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| English | Conll-03 (4-class)   |  **94.09**  | *94.3 [(Yamada et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.emnlp-main.523)* | [Flair English 4-class NER demo](https://huggingface.co/flair/ner-english-large)  |
| English | Ontonotes (18-class)  |  **90.93**  | *91.3 [(Yu et al., 2020)](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.577.pdf)* | [Flair English 18-class NER demo](https://huggingface.co/flair/ner-english-ontonotes-large) |
| German  | Conll-03 (4-class)   |  **92.31**  | *90.3 [(Yu et al., 2020)](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.577.pdf)* | [Flair German 4-class NER demo](https://huggingface.co/flair/ner-german-large)  |
| Dutch  | Conll-03  (4-class)  |  **95.25**  | *93.7 [(Yu et al., 2020)](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.577.pdf)* | [Flair Dutch 4-class NER demo](https://huggingface.co/flair/ner-dutch-large)  |
| Spanish  | Conll-03 (4-class)   |  **90.54** | *90.3 [(Yu et al., 2020)](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.577.pdf)* | [Flair Spanish 4-class NER demo](https://huggingface.co/flair/ner-spanish-large)  |

Many Flair sequence tagging models (named entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging etc.) are also hosted
on the [__🤗 Hugging Face model hub__](https://huggingface.co/models?library=flair&sort=downloads)! You can browse models, check detailed information on how they were trained, and even try each model out online!


## Quick Start

### Requirements and Installation

In your favorite virtual environment, simply do:

```
pip install flair
```

Flair requires Python 3.9+. 

### Example 1: Tag Entities in Text

Let's run **named entity recognition** (NER) over an example sentence. All you need to do is make a `Sentence`, load
a pre-trained model and use it to predict tags for the sentence:

```python
from flair.data import Sentence
from flair.nn import Classifier

# make a sentence
sentence = Sentence('I love Berlin .')

# load the NER tagger
tagger = Classifier.load('ner')

# run NER over sentence
tagger.predict(sentence)

# print the sentence with all annotations
print(sentence)
```

This should print:

```console
Sentence: "I love Berlin ." → ["Berlin"/LOC]
```

This means that "Berlin" was tagged as a **location entity** in this sentence. 

   * *to learn more about NER tagging in Flair, check out our [NER tutorial](https://flairnlp.github.io/docs/tutorial-basics/tagging-entities)!*


### Example 2: Detect Sentiment 

Let's run **sentiment analysis** over an example sentence to determine whether it is POSITIVE or NEGATIVE.
Same code as above, just a different model: 

```python
from flair.data import Sentence
from flair.nn import Classifier

# make a sentence
sentence = Sentence('I love Berlin .')

# load the NER tagger
tagger = Classifier.load('sentiment')

# run NER over sentence
tagger.predict(sentence)

# print the sentence with all annotations
print(sentence)
```

This should print:

```console
Sentence[4]: "I love Berlin ." → POSITIVE (0.9983)
```

This means that the sentence "I love Berlin" was tagged as having **POSITIVE** sentiment. 

   * *to learn more about sentiment analysis in Flair, check out our [sentiment analysis tutorial](https://flairnlp.github.io/docs/tutorial-basics/tagging-sentiment)!*

## Tutorials

On our new :fire: [**Flair documentation page**](https://flairnlp.github.io/docs/intro) you will find many tutorials to get you started!

## More Documentation

Another great place to start is the book [Natural Language Processing with Flair](https://www.amazon.com/Natural-Language-Processing-Flair-understanding/dp/1801072310)
and its accompanying [code repository](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Natural-Language-Processing-with-Flair), though it was
written for an older version of Flair and some examples may no longer work.
