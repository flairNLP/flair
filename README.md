A very simple framework for **state-of-the-art NLP**. Developed by [Humboldt University of Berlin](https://www.informatik.hu-berlin.de/en/forschung-en/gebiete/ml-en/) and friends.

---

Flair is:

* **A powerful NLP library.** Flair allows you to apply our state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP)
models to your text, such as named entity recognition (NER), part-of-speech tagging (PoS), 
  special support for [biomedical data](/resources/docs/HUNFLAIR.md),
 sense disambiguation and classification, with support for a rapidly growing number of languages.

* **A text embedding library.** Flair has simple interfaces that allow you to use and combine different word and
document embeddings, including our proposed **[Flair embeddings](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/C18-1139/)**, BERT embeddings and ELMo embeddings.

* **A PyTorch NLP framework.** Our framework builds directly on [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), making it easy to
train your own models and experiment with new approaches using Flair embeddings and classes.

Now at [version 0.11](https://github.com/flairNLP/flair/releases)!


## State-of-the-Art Models

Flair ships with state-of-the-art models for a range of NLP tasks. For instance, check out our latest NER models: 

| Language | Dataset | Flair | Best published | Model card & demo
|  ---  | ----------- | ---------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| English | Conll-03 (4-class)   |  **94.09**  | *94.3 [(Yamada et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.emnlp-main.523)* | [Flair English 4-class NER demo](https://huggingface.co/flair/ner-english-large)  |
| English | Ontonotes (18-class)  |  **90.93**  | *91.3 [(Yu et al., 2020)](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.577.pdf)* | [Flair English 18-class NER demo](https://huggingface.co/flair/ner-english-ontonotes-large) |
| German  | Conll-03 (4-class)   |  **92.31**  | *90.3 [(Yu et al., 2020)](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.577.pdf)* | [Flair German 4-class NER demo](https://huggingface.co/flair/ner-german-large)  |
| Dutch  | Conll-03  (4-class)  |  **95.25**  | *93.7 [(Yu et al., 2020)](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.577.pdf)* | [Flair Dutch 4-class NER demo](https://huggingface.co/flair/ner-dutch-large)  |
| Spanish  | Conll-03 (4-class)   |  **90.54** | *90.3 [(Yu et al., 2020)](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.577.pdf)* | [Flair Spanish 4-class NER demo](https://huggingface.co/flair/ner-spanish-large)  |

**New:** Most Flair sequence tagging models (named entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging etc.) are now hosted 
on the [__ü§ó HuggingFace model hub__](https://huggingface.co/models?library=flair&sort=downloads)! You can browse models, check detailed information on how they were trained, and even try each model out online!


## Quick Start

### Requirements and Installation

The project is based on PyTorch 1.5+ and Python 3.6+, because method signatures and type hints are beautiful.
If you do not have Python 3.6, install it first. [Here is how for Ubuntu 16.04](https://vsupalov.com/developing-with-python3-6-on-ubuntu-16-04/).
Then, in your favorite virtual environment, simply do:

```
pip install flair
```

### Example Usage

Let's run named entity recognition (NER) over an example sentence. All you need to do is make a `Sentence`, load
a pre-trained model and use it to predict tags for the sentence:

```python
from flair.data import Sentence
from flair.models import SequenceTagger

# make a sentence
sentence = Sentence('I love Berlin .')

# load the NER tagger
tagger = SequenceTagger.load('ner')

# run NER over sentence
tagger.predict(sentence)
```

Done! The `Sentence` now has entity annotations. Print the sentence to see what the tagger found.

```python
# print the sentence with all annotations
print(sentence)

print('The following NER tags are found:')

# iterate over entities and print each
for entity in sentence.get_spans('ner'):
    print(entity)
```

This should print:

```console
Sentence: "I love Berlin ." ‚Üí ["Berlin"/LOC]

The following NER tags are found:

Span[2:3]: "Berlin" ‚Üí LOC (0.999)
```

## Tutorials

We provide a set of quick tutorials to get you started with the library:

* [Tutorial 1: Basics](/resources/docs/TUTORIAL_1_BASICS.md)
* [Tutorial 2: Tagging your Text](/resources/docs/TUTORIAL_2_TAGGING.md)
* [Tutorial 3: Embedding Words](/resources/docs/TUTORIAL_3_WORD_EMBEDDING.md)
* [Tutorial 4: List of All Word Embeddings](/resources/docs/TUTORIAL_4_ELMO_BERT_FLAIR_EMBEDDING.md)
* [Tutorial 5: Embedding Documents](/resources/docs/TUTORIAL_5_DOCUMENT_EMBEDDINGS.md)
* [Tutorial 6: Loading a Dataset](/resources/docs/TUTORIAL_6_CORPUS.md)
* [Tutorial 7: Training a Model](/resources/docs/TUTORIAL_7_TRAINING_A_MODEL.md)
* [Tutorial 8: Training your own Flair Embeddings](/resources/docs/TUTORIAL_9_TRAINING_LM_EMBEDDINGS.md)
* [Tutorial 9: Training a Zero Shot Text Classifier (TARS)](/resources/docs/TUTORIAL_10_TRAINING_ZERO_SHOT_MODEL.md)

The tutorials explain how the base NLP classes work, how you can load pre-trained models to tag your
text, how you can embed your text with different word or document embeddings, and how you can train your own
language models, sequence labeling models, and text classification models. Let us know if anything is unclear.

There is also a dedicated landing page for our **[biomedical NER and datasets](/resources/docs/HUNFLAIR.md)** with
installation instructions and tutorials.
