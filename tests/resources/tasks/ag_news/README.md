## AG_NEWS

Data is taken from [here](https://www.di.unipi.it/~gulli/AG_corpus_of_news_articles.html).

The dataset contains a collection of news articles grouped into different categories.
We took a small random sample and converted it to the expected format of our data fetcher:
```
__label__<class_name> <text>
```
