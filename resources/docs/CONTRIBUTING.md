# Contributing to Flair

We are happy to accept your contributions to make `flair` better and more awesome! To avoid unnecessary work on either side, please stick to the following process:

1. Check if there is already [an issue](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/flair/issues) for your concern.
2. If there is not, open a new one to start a discussion. We hate to close finished PRs!
3. If we decide your concern needs code changes, we would be happy to accept a pull request. Please consider the commit guidelines below.

In case you just want to help out and don't know where to start, [issues with "help wanted" label](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/flair/labels/help%20wanted) are good for first-time contributors.
